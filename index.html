      <section>
        <p>I have broad research interests in evolutionary biology, genetics and developmental biology, motivated by my desire to understand biological diversity and complexity. So far, my research is focused on studying genetics and evolution of life cycles observed in microbial eukaryotes, which continue to provide a bottomless treasure trove of unexplored biological diversity. Specifically, I have studied mating systems in ciliates and fungi to decipher their genetic basis and their evolutionary implications. I have also studied the genetics and population dynamics of pathogenic lifestyle of some fungi. I am a naturalist at heart. Rather than limiting myself to one system, I find it exciting to study unique traits in various model and non-model organisms, especially when these traits force us to learn more about, and enable a different perspective on, common patterns in biology. For example, my research has addressed questions including 1) what are the evolutionary implications of having more than two sexes, as observed in many ciliates? 2) how does genetic rewiring allow a fungus to mate with itself and produce pathogenic propagules? In addition, I am examining genetic and developmental bases of anisogamy in the fungal genus Allomyces, diversification and evolution of starvation response in the ciliate genus Tetrahymena, and evolution of gene copy number control in ciliates. A major part of the above projects has been developing and applying tools including mutagenesis and approaches including experimental evolution and comparative -OMICs. As of late, in addition to studying micro-eukaryotes, I am getting more and more interested in exploring the biotechnological potential of bacterial systems. In this context, I am hoping to leverage metaomics approaches, laboratory cultivation techniques, genetic and metabolic analyses to generate system-level understanding of bacteria that produce electricity.  </p>
